# DigitalOcean Chrome/Puppeteer Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 **The Issue**
DigitalOcean App Platform doesn't have Chrome/Chromium pre-installed, and trying to use a specific executable path causes errors.

## ✅ **The Solution Applied**
1. **Removed hard-coded Chrome paths** - Let Puppeteer use its bundled Chromium
2. **Simplified App Spec** - Removed problematic environment variables
3. **Added build script** - Ensures Puppeteer is properly installed with Chromium
4. **Updated server logic** - Only uses executable path if explicitly provided and valid

## 🚀 **How to Deploy the Fix**

### **If your app is already deployed:**
1. Go to your DigitalOcean App dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables  
3. **Remove these variables if they exist:**
   - `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`
   - `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD`
4. Keep only: `NODE_ENV=production`
5. Redeploy your app (it will auto-deploy since you pushed the code changes)

### **For new deployments:**
The updated code will work automatically with the simplified App Spec configuration.

## 🔍 **What Changed**

### **server.js Changes:**
- Removed Chrome executable path detection
- Let Puppeteer use its bundled Chromium by default
- Only set executable path if explicitly provided via environment variable

### **App Spec Changes:**
- Removed `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` environment variable
- Removed `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` environment variable  
- Added custom build script for better Puppeteer setup

### **Added Files:**
- `build.sh` - Ensures clean Puppeteer installation with Chromium

## 🎯 **Why This Works**
DigitalOcean App Platform uses Ubuntu-based containers. By letting Puppeteer download and manage its own Chromium binary, we avoid path compatibility issues and ensure the browser executable is always available.

## 🧪 **Testing**
The changes have been tested locally in production mode and work correctly. Puppeteer will automatically download and use its bundled Chromium.

## 📊 **Performance Notes**
- The bundled Chromium adds ~280MB to your deployment
- This is normal and expected for Puppeteer-based applications
- DigitalOcean's Pro plan ($12/month) is recommended for consistent performance

## 🆘 **If You Still Have Issues**
1. Check the build logs for Puppeteer installation errors
2. Ensure you're using the Pro plan (1GB+ RAM recommended)
3. Consider increasing the instance size if memory issues persist

The app should now deploy successfully on DigitalOcean App Platform! 🎉
